<p><em>“Expectations trip up things just as much as assumptions do.”</em>
<em>~ PM Insights Podcast Episode 109 - Karen Cherrett</em></p>
<p>Have you ever been disappointed after you were told something would be in a certain way?  Maybe you reserved a hotel room in a beach destination online and it advertised a waterfront view only to get there and find that the waterfront is a water treatment plant.  You had a very vivid expectation of a beautiful beach with an ocean that sprawls into the horizon and you received the opposite.  On top of that, your room smells.</p>
<p>Managing expectations is probably one of the hardest yet most important parts of any implementation.  Making sure you and your clients know what the end result consists of and how you’re going to get there are the gears that make the project move forward.  When a client is handed to you, you may not know what was discussed or promised beforehand.  So it is up to you to find out and discuss what the client is expecting from every piece of the project.</p>
<p>I typically bring this up during my very first call.  I introduce myself, go over a couple really quick preliminary questions then try to dive right into what the client wants and what we can do.  Sometimes there is a miscommunication between the client and the sales or service team.  A common occurrence is they are told one thing and they heard something else.  So as soon as I can I try to lay the baseline so that the client knows exactly what my job is and what it entails.  Also, I try to communicate not only what is expected of us as a service provider but also what is expected of them as a client.  Sometimes the client has the impression that the software you are implementing is magic and has the ability to make the most delicious milkshakes and sometimes the client only knows the bare minimum about the product and the only reason they are switching over is due to price.  In these scenarios I try to level things out by asking questions about them and what they need. </p>
<p>A lot of these questions are simple information gathering questions like, “when are you looking to go live?”, “What do you plan on getting out of this project?”, “What are the areas of the system you feel you need to use and learn the most and why?”.  These very simple questions can help me as a service provider focus on the clients expectations and either build upon them or lower them depending on what the needs are.  </p>
<p>Sometimes I find that they really didn’t need to get milkshakes, but was promised it during the sales process and therefore now it’s something they are looking forward to.  One of the hardest parts of my job is to lower that unattainable expectation.  Not only is the client opening the curtains on the water treatment plant at this point but you as an implementation person (sometimes the first person outside of sales) are in danger of losing the client. <br>
At this point it's easy to say "oh well" and send this account back up the pipeline to deal with.  However,t hat can also jeopardize the account.  In my experience any time a client changes hands without an established rapport, there is a slight risk of losing them.  Especially if the client is upset. The alternative to this would be to think outside of the box and offer the client some options such as: “No, our system cannot make milkshakes but maybe I could work something out with the delivery team to pick one up at the fast food place down the block from your office.” </p>
<p>This simple action establishes the expectation that you as an implementation person are willing to do whatever is needed to help the client find their solution.   As long as you are sincere and truly want to help the client with what is needed, I have found that most of the time the client will still move forward.  Maybe that promise was an additional item thrown in during the negotiations and price and service are the true solutions that the client needs.  Price can always been revisited and service can always be added.  But by going to bat for the client and being honest you're setting the expectation that you'll do your best and the client can rely on you and that your service has value above the items they are purchasing. </p>
<p>The other side of expectations is when the client has a low expectation of the end product.  That’s when you can swoop in and offer the same items you give every client and seem like you’re giving more as a result.  I love having conversations with a client and have them ask, “You can do that?” and being able to respond: “Sure, we can!”.  It adds value to their purchase, adds value to your service and lets them feel like their getting a bonus.  Who doesn’t love a bonus?  </p>
<p>Another expectation that needs to be communicated and understood every time is client engagement.  During the welcome call I like to not only to go over what we can offer them as a service, but what is expected of them during the implementation process.  Some clients think that we just push a button and their account it set up.  Others may think that it will be an arduous endeavour that will take months.  I try to let the client know truthfully how long it will take and what I need from them in order for it to take the time quoted.  This is also something that is baked into the baseline we establish in the welcome call.  If a client wants an implementation to happen sooner rather than later, then I will hand them a list of the things I need and when I will need them by.  If the request is filled, I will hold up my end of the bargain as best as I can.  If the client comes back and says that they can only get half of the items needed or that it will take longer, then we adjust the timeline.  Overall what is expected is the client to be engaged when I needed them to be.  Too many times have I gotten an account and the client just disappears only to have them come back a month later looking for a finished product.  Even after repeated attempts to contact them.</p>
<p>In every client conversation setting the expectations during the welcome call is probably the hardest and yet most important.  If you’re frank, honest and willing to think outside of the box at times, it will set the tone and scope of the entire implementation as well as the client/service relationship.  Clear, effective communication is an absolute at this point.  Offer alternatives and let the client feel that they can rely on you and you will never under deliver.  However, it never hurts to over deliver.  </p>
